# VLAN & IP Addressing Lab

## Project Summary
Built a hands-on networking lab using enterprise-grade switching equipment and Cisco Packet Tracer to practice VLAN segmentation, structured IP addressing plans, and inter-VLAN routing across isolated network segments.

## Work Context
At Pures College (Computer IT Instructor, 2024–2025), this lab environment supported structured classroom delivery where students configured trunk ports, access ports, and inter-VLAN routing on managed switches. Each session followed a repeatable scenario covering VLAN assignment, IP address planning, and connectivity validation.

## Current Implementation
I continue extending the same lab scenarios in a personal home lab, testing segmentation patterns, routing behavior, and failover handling across physical and simulated environments.

## Results and Impact
- VLAN segments configured: 6
- Endpoints simulated: 20+
- Lab scenarios delivered: 4 (trunking, routing, addressing, failover)

## Deliverables
- Lab topology diagrams and addressing plans documented per scenario
- Repeatable configuration templates for trunk port, access port, and inter-VLAN routing setups
- Troubleshooting reference covering common VLAN and addressing issues

## Technical Notes
- Scenarios cover trunking configuration, VLAN pruning, spanning tree behavior, and static/dynamic routing integration.
- IP addressing plans use CIDR notation with documented subnet allocation per VLAN segment.
- Physical Cisco switch and Packet Tracer simulations are used together to bridge theory and practice.
