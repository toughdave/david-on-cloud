# Portfolio Web Operations & Domain Administration

## Project Summary
Built and operated my portfolio website as a production-style web and domain operations project covering CMS delivery, DNS administration, Microsoft 365 service governance, and release validation.

## Work Context
At FUTA (Systems & Data Analyst / System Programmer, 2017–2023) and Pures College (Computer IT Instructor, 2024–2025), I handled implementation handovers, post-deployment support, and operational stabilization across high-visibility systems. Those same controls shaped how I run this website project end to end.

## Current Implementation
I now apply the same release discipline to my portfolio operations, combining CMS governance, domain administration, Microsoft 365 access controls, and Docker-assisted validation checks before publishing updates.

## Results and Impact
- Production domain managed: 1 (`davidoncloud.com`)
- Core service layers: 3 (web delivery, DNS routing, identity administration)
- Release workflow: 1 (validation and rollback-aware updates)

## Deliverables
- CMS-managed content model with structured section updates
- Domain and DNS operations checklist for safe routing changes
- Release validation workflow with rollback-aware checkpoints

## Technical Notes
- Website content is managed from JSON/CMS sources with controlled rendering updates.
- Domain and DNS changes are verified before and after release windows.
- Identity and access updates are handled through Microsoft 365 admin workflows.
