# DNS & DHCP Services Lab

## Project Summary
Configured and validated DNS and DHCP infrastructure services in a mixed Windows and Linux lab environment, building foundational skills for reliable name resolution, automated IP address management, and cross-platform client connectivity.

## Work Context
At Pures College (Computer IT Instructor, 2024–2025), this DNS/DHCP workflow supported practical networking lessons on name resolution, lease behavior, and service troubleshooting. Students configured forward and reverse zones, DHCP scopes, and validated cross-platform connectivity.

## Current Implementation
I continue validating the same service patterns in a personal lab across segmented environments, testing lease lifecycle behavior, relay agent configuration, and DNS failover scenarios.

## Results and Impact
- DHCP leases managed: 50+
- DNS zones configured: 2 (forward, reverse)
- Client OS platforms validated: 3 (Windows, Linux, VM lab)

## Deliverables
- DNS zone configurations with A, AAAA, PTR, CNAME, and MX records
- DHCP scope templates with address ranges, lease durations, and reservation policies
- Cross-platform validation procedures for Windows and Linux client connectivity

## Technical Notes
- DHCP lifecycle testing covers initial allocation, renewal timing, and failover scenarios.
- Common troubleshooting: IP conflicts, scope exhaustion, relay agent misconfiguration.
- Platform-specific configuration requirements documented for Windows and Linux clients.
