# Operational Readiness Checks

## Project Summary
Performed systematic preventative maintenance and operational readiness verification on examination technology infrastructure before high-stakes testing periods, ensuring device compliance, software currency, and security baseline adherence across 150+ systems each exam cycle.

## Work Context
At FUTA (Systems & Data Analyst / System Programmer, 2017–2023), this readiness process was executed before each examination period. Assessments covered OS patch levels, antivirus currency, application version compliance, and hardware functionality across laptops and desktops used in examination environments. Remediation was coordinated with IT support teams within a 24-hour turnaround target.

## Current Implementation
I continue applying the same pre-flight verification model in personal operations checklists and lab maintenance routines, using structured readiness assessments and status tracking for device compliance.

## Results and Impact
- Devices checked per cycle: 150+
- Pre-exam compliance rate: 98%
- Issue remediation turnaround: 24 hours

## Deliverables
- Pre-examination readiness assessment checklists
- Remediation tracking dashboards with status summaries
- Historical compliance reports supporting trend analysis and resource planning

## Technical Notes
- Assessment scope: OS patch levels, antivirus definitions, application versions, hardware functionality.
- Security baseline checks include user account configurations, access control settings, and network connectivity.
- Readiness outcomes are logged per cycle to support continuous process improvement.
