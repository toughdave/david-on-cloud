# Examination Integrity Monitoring

## Project Summary
Designed and implemented a multi-layered examination integrity workflow integrating biometric identity verification, CCTV-based monitoring, and structured incident reporting to strengthen compliance and audit readiness across 12+ high-stakes examination cycles.

## Work Context
At FUTA (Systems & Data Analyst / System Programmer, 2017–2023), this workflow supported high-stakes exam operations where biometric fingerprint devices authenticated student identities before hall entry, CCTV footage was systematically logged, and incident reports were captured using standardized templates aligned with institutional compliance standards.

## Current Implementation
I continue maintaining the same control flow as checklist-driven templates in personal operations projects for readiness drills and audit reporting.

## Results and Impact
- Verification compliance rate: 98%
- Exam cycles covered: 12+
- Critical gaps in incident handling: 0

## Deliverables
- Biometric verification setup and calibration procedures
- CCTV monitoring workflow with incident logging templates
- Audit trail documentation linking verification records, footage timestamps, and incident reports

## Technical Notes
- Biometric devices were calibrated and tested before each examination period.
- CCTV workflows maintained chain-of-custody for recorded footage used in post-exam reviews.
- Incident templates captured irregularities with enough detail for disciplinary and audit processes.
