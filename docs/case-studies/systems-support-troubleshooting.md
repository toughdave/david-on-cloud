# Systems Support & Troubleshooting

## Project Summary
Delivered frontline Windows and Linux systems support through structured triage, documented root-cause workflows, and SLA-aligned incident handling across 200+ tracked requests spanning hardware, OS, network, and application issues for 4,000+ users.

## Work Context
At FUTA (Systems & Data Analyst / System Programmer, 2017–2023), I handled incidents across examination, admissions, and departmental IT systems serving 4,000+ users, coordinating with operations leads to keep services stable during peak cycles. At Pures College (Computer IT Instructor, 2024–2025), I maintained lab workstations and resolved software/hardware issues across classroom environments for 250+ students.

## Current Implementation
I apply the same structured support pattern in consultant operations, including domain/DNS checks, Microsoft 365 access remediation, Docker-based validation utilities, and documented handover notes for recurring issues.

## Results and Impact
- Incidents resolved: 200+ (hardware, OS, network, application)
- SLA compliance: 95% (response and resolution targets)
- Users supported: 4,000+ (across FUTA, Pures, and consulting)
- Target turnaround: 24 hrs (critical incident resolution)

## Deliverables
- Incident tracking logs capturing symptoms, diagnostic steps, resolution actions, and time-to-resolution metrics
- Known-issues knowledge base organized by category with tested fixes, escalation notes, and prevention actions
- Escalation documentation with reproducible diagnostics, annotated screenshots, and clear handover notes
- Rapid-response support during high-pressure exam and classroom periods

## Technical Notes
- Diagnostic tools: Event Viewer, PowerShell, journalctl, ping/traceroute, ipconfig/ifconfig.
- Issue categories: boot failures, driver conflicts, peripheral malfunctions, projection systems, network drops.
- Remote and onsite support adapted to access constraints and active workflow schedules.
- SLA tracking covers response time and resolution time across multiple academic terms.
- Prevention recommendations documented alongside incident resolutions to reduce recurrence.
