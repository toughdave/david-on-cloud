# Systems Support & Troubleshooting

## Project Summary
Provided frontline Windows and Linux systems support across academic IT environments, diagnosing and resolving hardware, operating system, and application issues while maintaining structured incident documentation and SLA compliance for 200+ tracked support requests.

## Work Context
At FUTA (Systems & Data Analyst / System Programmer, 2017–2023) and Pures College (Computer IT Instructor, 2024–2025), this incident-response workflow supported day-to-day system stability with structured diagnostics, logging, and escalation discipline. Issues ranged from hardware failures and OS boot problems to network connectivity and peripheral malfunctions across Windows and Linux platforms.

## Current Implementation
I continue using the same root-cause and knowledge-base pattern in personal support workflows and lab operations, tracking resolution steps and building documented references for recurring issues.

## Results and Impact
- Incidents resolved: 200+
- SLA compliance: 95% (response and resolution)
- Knowledge base maintained: 1 (documented recurring fixes)

## Deliverables
- Incident tracking logs capturing symptoms, diagnostic steps, resolution actions, and time-to-resolution
- Known-issues knowledge base with root cause analyses and validated resolution steps
- Escalation documentation for critical incidents with comprehensive troubleshooting records

## Technical Notes
- Diagnostic scope: hardware failures, OS configuration, application errors, network connectivity, peripheral devices.
- SLA tracking covers response time and resolution time across multiple academic terms.
- Prevention recommendations documented alongside incident resolutions to reduce recurrence.
