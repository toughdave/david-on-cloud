# Systems Support & Troubleshooting

## Project Summary
Delivered frontline Windows and Linux systems support through structured triage, documented root-cause workflows, and SLA-aligned incident handling across 200+ tracked requests.

## Work Context
At FUTA (Systems & Data Analyst / System Programmer, 2017–2023) and Pures College (Computer IT Instructor, 2024–2025), this incident-response workflow supported day-to-day system stability with structured diagnostics, logging, and escalation discipline. Issues ranged from hardware failures and OS boot problems to network connectivity and peripheral malfunctions across Windows and Linux platforms.

## Current Implementation
I apply the same support pattern in consultant operations, including domain/DNS checks, Microsoft 365 access remediation, Docker-based validation utilities, and documented handover notes for recurring issues.

## Results and Impact
- Incidents resolved: 200+
- SLA compliance: 95% (response and resolution)
- Knowledge base maintained: 1 (documented recurring fixes)

## Deliverables
- Incident tracking logs capturing symptoms, diagnostic steps, resolution actions, and time-to-resolution
- Known-issues knowledge base with root cause analyses and validated resolution steps
- Escalation documentation for critical incidents with comprehensive troubleshooting records

## Technical Notes
- Diagnostic scope: hardware failures, OS configuration, application errors, network connectivity, peripheral devices.
- SLA tracking covers response time and resolution time across multiple academic terms.
- Prevention recommendations documented alongside incident resolutions to reduce recurrence.
