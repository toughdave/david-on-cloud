# Routing & VPN Basics Lab

## Project Summary
Designed and operated a multi-site network simulation lab to practice routing fundamentals, VPN tunnel configuration, and connectivity troubleshooting using both static and dynamic routing protocols.

## Work Context
At Pures College (Computer IT Instructor, 2024–2025), these routing and VPN exercises guided learners through structured troubleshooting and network behavior analysis. Scenarios covered static routing, dynamic routing convergence, and VPN re-establishment after link failures.

## Current Implementation
I continue extending these scenarios in a personal lab to test failover handling, connectivity recovery patterns, and encrypted tunnel behavior across isolated network segments.

## Results and Impact
- Site links simulated: 5
- Routing modes covered: 2 (static, dynamic)
- VPN scenarios tested: 4 (split-tunnel, full-tunnel, failover, fallback)

## Deliverables
- Multi-branch topology configurations for enterprise WAN simulation
- VPN tunnel templates covering split-tunnel, full-tunnel, and failover setups
- Troubleshooting logs and packet traces documenting common routing and VPN issues

## Technical Notes
- Scenarios include routing table convergence, asymmetric path detection, and VPN re-establishment after link failures.
- Both Packet Tracer simulations and physical lab equipment are used for validation.
- Documented reference library of common issues and validated resolution steps.
