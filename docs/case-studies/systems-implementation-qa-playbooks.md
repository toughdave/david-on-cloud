# Systems Implementation & QA Playbooks

## Project Summary
Created comprehensive implementation checklists, quality assurance scripts, and standardized documentation to bring consistency and repeatability to software rollouts, lab environment provisioning, and technical deployment workflows across classroom and examination environments.

## Work Context
Across FUTA (Systems & Data Analyst / System Programmer, 2017–2023) and Pures College (Computer IT Instructor, 2024–2025), these playbooks stabilized rollouts and reduced configuration drift across teams. Testing gates, compatibility checks, and rollback procedures were defined for each deployment phase.

## Current Implementation
I continue maintaining the same checklist-first model in personal projects to keep deployments repeatable and auditable, with version-tracked playbooks covering common installation and configuration scenarios.

## Results and Impact
- Deployments standardized: 30+
- Setup time improvement: 15% faster
- Playbooks maintained: 6 (install, QA, rollback, docs, onboarding, reset)

## Deliverables
- Step-by-step QA scripts covering pre-deployment checks, installation verification, and post-deployment testing
- Handoff checklists capturing configuration details, version information, and known-issue workarounds
- Living library of deployment playbooks for development tools, OS configuration, VM setup, and network services

## Technical Notes
- Playbook scope: Eclipse, VS Code, MySQL installation; OS configuration; VM setup; network service provisioning.
- Each playbook includes version tracking to stay current with software updates.
- Rollback procedures are documented alongside forward deployment steps.
