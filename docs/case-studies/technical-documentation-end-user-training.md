# Technical Documentation & End-User Training

## Project Summary
Produced comprehensive standard operating procedures, technical runbooks, and hands-on training materials to support system rollouts, troubleshooting workflows, and staff onboarding across academic IT environments, directly reducing support ticket volume and accelerating new team member productivity.

## Work Context
At FUTA (Systems & Data Analyst / System Programmer, 2017–2023) and Pures College (Computer IT Instructor, 2024–2025), these documentation assets were central to onboarding, support consistency, and smoother handoffs between technical teams. Training workshops translated complex system workflows into practical, actionable instructions for both technical and non-technical staff.

## Current Implementation
I continue building the same runbook-first approach in personal projects to preserve repeatable setup and troubleshooting workflows, maintaining a centralized knowledge base of documented solutions and configuration templates.

## Results and Impact
- Guides delivered: 12 (SOPs and runbooks)
- Training workshops led: 6 (team onboarding sessions)
- Users supported: 100+ (staff and students)

## Deliverables
- Step-by-step installation guides, configuration runbooks, and quick-reference materials
- Onboarding documentation packages covering system access, tool configurations, and key contacts
- Centralized knowledge base of documented solutions and known issues

## Technical Notes
- Documentation covers system administration, software deployment, troubleshooting, and escalation paths.
- Knowledge base entries reduced repeat support tickets by providing self-service resolution steps.
- Onboarding packages enabled faster ramp-up and consistent adherence to operational standards.
